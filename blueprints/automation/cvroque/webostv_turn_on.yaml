  name: LG webOS Smart TV - Turn On Action
  description: "\n## LG webOS Smart TV - Turn On Action for 2022.2+\n\nThis blueprint
    will run anytime the user turns the media player on through Home Assistant (UI
    or service).\n\nAdding this blueprint will allow the user to turn on the LG webOS
    TV through the UI after updating to HA 2022.2, without this blueprint or similar
    automation the Turn On button won't be displayed due to a breaking change. This
    is basically a shortcut to manually adding the automation described in the [official
    documentation][1].\n\nThe default action is to send a Wake On Lan magic packet
    in order to turn the TV on. Aditionally you can also setup custom actions for
    alternate solutions such as: using an IR remote, turning a smart socket on or
    calling an script. This is also useful for TV models connected through Wireless
    that have issues with Wake on Lan.\n\n\n### Requirements:\n- [LG webOS Smart TV][2]
    integration\n- [Wake On Lan][3] added to configuration.yaml\n\n### Changelog:\n-
    2022.02.03 - First release\n- 2022.02.06 - Added austom actions\n- 2022.04.27
    - Added actions to run after TV is turned On\n  \n\n[1]: https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/webostv/#turn-on-action\n[2]:
