## Perform actions when an appliance has finished
##
## This blueprint is my improved version of an original blueprint by @sbyx:
## - Hysteresis presented as a duration selector. (https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/blueprint/selectors/#duration-selector)
## - Entities limited to power sensors by device class (https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/blueprint/selectors/#device_class)
