## HASS.io

This file contains specific details about my HASS.io installation.

### Host hardware

The system is currently running on a Raspberry Pi 2B. It is equipped with an ? GB SD Card.

### Installed Add-ons

#### Nginx Proxy

The Nginx Proxy enables me to service more than one application to the Internet with exposing only 1 port to the outside world. Next to that, it's able to service LE certificate renewal.

#### Duckdns

Although it believe is has not changed for ages, my ISP officialy provides me with a dynamic IP address. To be able to always use a hostname, I let the addon ping the duckdns service.

Using the separate addon, enables me to service multiple domains at once.

A hostname is convenient for remembering, but, more importantly, required for using certificates from Let's Encrypt.

#### Lets Encrypt

#### SSH

#### Samba

#### Backups

I create backups with the [Home Assistant Google Drive Backup addon](https://github.com/sabeechen/hassio-google-drive-backup).

## Custom Components

### HACS

To manage my custom components, I use [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/).

### RDW

The [RDW sensor module for Home Assistant](https://github.com/eelcohn/home-assistant-rdw/).

Provides information for the family cars. Not available through HACS.

## Z-Wave

I am using Z-Wave. I started using it as a reliable, secure and 2-way alternative to cheap 433 MHz devices (mainly Klik-Aan-Klik-Uit). This was before Philips Hue and Ikea Tr√•dfri became large and mainstream, and thus the Zigbee protocol.

Until the end of 2019 I have been using the standard Hassio [Z-Wave integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zwave/), but have migrated to [Zwave2Mqtt](https://github.com/OpenZWave/Zwave2Mqtt) since.

The reason to switch to Zwave2Mqtt is, to de-couple Home Assistant from my Z-Wave network. This should provide me with a healthier and more stable Z-Wave mesh. Using the Z-Wave integration, you will restart your entire network with every restart of Home Assistant, which can lead to unexpected results. And you need to wait minutes for all entities to show up.

### Configuration

I have these components in place:

- Official Hassio Moquitto Add-on
- [Zwave2Mqtt Hassio Community Add-on](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-zwave2mqtt)
- Hassio [MQTT integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/), including [discovery](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/discovery/)

There are some good instructions available to set this up:

- 1
- 2

Create a new Home Assistant user `zwave2mqtt` through the Home Assistant UI. This user can be used to login to Mosquitto from the Zwave2Mqtt.

Install the Mosquitto broker add-on. The default configuration is fine. Start the broker.

Install the Open Z-Wave to MQTT addon. The default configuration is fine. Start the addon.

Add a panel to the Home Assistant UI in `configuration.yaml`. This will make it easier to access the web interface. Restart Home Assistant.

```yaml
panel_iframe:
  zwave2mqtt:
    title: Z-Wave to MQTT
    icon: hass:z-wave
    url: http://hassio.local:8091
```

Open the panel. If asked for a username and password, enter your Home Assistant user.

Follow the instructions in one of the articles.

#### Zwave2Mqtt

When using the MQTT integration and automatic discovery, you need to make sure that the MQTT prefix is `homeassistant`.

#### Renaming devices and entities

After your Z-Wave devices have been discovered you will end up with unuseful or ugly entity names. Some of these can be edited easily through the UI.

**WARNING**: This paragraph describes how to manually edit files in the `.storage` folder.
This is hazardous if you don't know what you are doing.
Always stop Home Assistant first and make a backup of the `.storage` folder before you make any edits.
DO THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK. I am NOT responsible if you screw up.

Rename displayed name of devices. Through UI.

Repace nodeid's in entitiy names with something more usefil. Can be done trough UI. But easier with search/replace through text file `<config>/.storage/core.entity_registry`.
Replace all occurences of `.nodeid_18` with `.charging_station`.
Notice the prepending dot (`.`).
This will let you rename only sensors and switches. Be careful not to change the unique ID of the entity.

Search and replace is based on the "label" attribute in the JSON message.

entity type | search | replace
--- | --- | ---
sensor | `gas_density` | `voltage`
sensor | `generic` | `current`
sensor | `power` | `energy`
sensor | `power_8` | `power`

Hide sensors:

- `sensor.*_gas_density_17`
- `sensor.*_generic_21`
- `sensor.*_power_1`
- `sensor.*_power_2`
- `sensor.*_power_9`
- `sensor.*_temperature*`
- `sensor.*_water`

### Devices

An overview of the devices I use:

- Neo Coolcam Smart Power Plug
- Neo Coolcam Motion Sensor
- Neo Coolcam Siren
- Fibaro Smart Power Plug
- BeNext Multisensor

## Hardware

Connected (smart) hardware:

- Sonos speakers
- [LG WebOS TV](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/webostv/)

### Sonos

Sonos speakers are added through discovery. This is more convenient than configuring manually.

## Tips & Tricks

Editing your configuration

- [Tracking your lovelace UI file](#tracking-your-lovelace-ui-file)
- [Testing and debugging automations with automation editor](#testing-and-debugging-automations-with-automation-editor)

Database

- [Limit database growth](#limit-database-growth)

### Tracking your Lovelace UI file

To start tracking the lovelace UI file `.storage/lovelace`, you need to force-add it to git:

```bash
git add -f .storage/lovelace
```

### Testing and debugging automations with automation editor

Using the automation editor is an easy way to test automations or to create temporary automations for debugging.

To use the automation editor in combination with packages, there needs to be [a separate `automations.yaml` file in the root of the config directory](./automations.yaml), with a least one properly formatted automation. My config has a dummy automation to prevent that the configuration becomes invalid.

### Limit database growth

To limit database growth, I limit [recording](https://home-assistant.io/components/recorder/) as much as possible and purge the database daily for values older than 3 days.
